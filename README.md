Two Convolution Neural Network based implementations for image classification. We used Tensorflow and Keras for these implentations. 
  1. In the first case, we used multiple layers of convolution before DNN layers. In order to avoid overfitting, we applied augementation for the training set images. However, the training dataset was too small to prevent overfitting.
  2. In the second case, we used transfer learning and dropout techniques to avoid overfitting. And the validation accuracy reached to more than 96% accuracy.
