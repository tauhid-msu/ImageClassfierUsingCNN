Two Convolution Neural Network based implementations for image classification. I used Tensorflow and Keras for these implentations. 
  1. In the first case, I used multiple layers of convolution before DNN layers. In order to avoid overfitting, I applied augementation for the training set images. However, the training dataset was too small to prevent overfitting.
  2. In the second case, I used transfer learning and dropout techniques to avoid overfitting. And the validation accuracy reached to more than 96% accuracy.
